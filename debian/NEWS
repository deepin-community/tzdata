tzdata (2023d-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    From 2023c-8 on the tzdata package ships only timezones that follow the
    current rules of geographical region (continent or ocean) and city name.
    All legacy timezone symlinks (old or merged timezones mentioned in the
    upstream backward file) were moved to tzdata-legacy. This includes the
    US/* timezones.

    Please install tzdata-legacy in case you need the legacy timezones or to
    restore the previous behavior. This might be needed in case the system
    provides timezone-aware data over the network (e. g. SQL databases).
